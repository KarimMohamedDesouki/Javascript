# JavaScript Labs at ITI

Welcome to the JavaScript Labs repository for your ITI course! This repository contains the solutions and resources for the JavaScript labs conducted during your course.

## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is an essential technology for front-end and back-end web development, as well as for building desktop and mobile applications.

These labs are designed to help you understand the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and more.

## Installation

To start working with JavaScript on your Windows machine, you don't need to install any specific software. All you need is a text editor and a web browser. Here's how to get started:

1. **Choose a Text Editor**: You can use any text editor of your choice for writing JavaScript code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Notepad++.

2. **Set Up a Local Server (Optional)**: If you're working on projects that require server-side JavaScript (Node.js), you'll need to install Node.js and set up a local server environment. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions.

## Usage

Each lab session is organized into separate directories within this repository. Inside each directory, you'll find the JavaScript files, along with any additional resources or instructions provided during the lab session.

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/KarimMohamedDesouki/Javascript-Labs.git


Then, navigate to the specific lab directory you're interested in and explore the JavaScript files and resources.
