# Abstract Classes

An abstract class is a class that has been declared abstract and has the option to include abstract methods. They cannot be instantiated, but they can be used as subclasses.

# Interface classes

For classes, interfaces are often an executable format. It forces the derived classes to fully implement the methods by defining their general specifications without actually implementing them. As a result, only the methods' attributes are described once in the interface; their methods are then implemented as needed following inheritance. Interfaces start with the letter I in all.NET versions and are distinguished from other components by this property. Its definition is quite similar to that of classes, with the exception that their methods lack code. An instance cannot be produced from an interface; it lacks a constructor and a field.


# Inheritance in Function Constructors in JavaScript

Constructor functions are used in JavaScript to build objects that share a structure. Prototypes are the means by which inheritance is accomplished within constructor functions. A child constructor can inherit properties and methods from its parent by attaching its prototype to an instance of the parent constructor. Prototypal inheritance is the term for this type of inheritance.
